Given a sample row from two tables:

- `Shift`: contains the period of time when a delivery person was online, number of deliveries made, and total amount made during this time.
- `Deliverer`: contains delivery person's id, email address, zipcode, and associated submarket.

The challenge was to write various queries to find insights. The `query_challenge.Rmd` gives an overview of the data, the tasks, and my solutions. This is an example of how I'd construct an ETL job and use SQL to extract insights.

The `query_challenge.R` can be run to test two cases: one when deliverer works past midnight and one when deliverer doesn't.
